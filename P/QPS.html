  </br><b>Quality&acute;s Providers Scorecards</b>
  </br> This system uses a huge variety of technologies. Requires Oracle&acute;s Forms, Reports, Discoverer, JSP, ASP, HTML (intranet an internet, this affects the way you need to make the connections to Data Base), JavaScript, PLSQL Functions and Stored Procedures in conjunction with Unix code and mainly Oracle Reports, stored procedures that help consolidate information, having a functionality similar to the oracle&acute;s materialized views. The system uses a mix of Oracle&acute;s tables and the ERP, BAAN&acute;s tables. The system is able to access the information through the intranet at all levels of supplies area using Oracle SSO security, starting in management area and finishing in the quality department. The schemas involved in the execution of the Stored Procedures are controlled by concurrent programs, these execute code on UNIX, and run Reports in predefined dates, dates that are controlled and administrated by supplies employees. Oracle Discoverer adds the flexibility that is required to customize the reports needed, but the complexity of some of them, makes appear Oracle Reports helped with Forms to be able to make really specific executions. Java code runs in the Oracle Application Server for another type of Reports, which are use within and outside the company, taking the providers crucial part in here, this means that the information has to be updated and be able to exit to the Internet, for security reasons, the connections of the information in the ERP can not be made, getting an additional point to resolve, the system have to use different servers and ASP technology to present this information. Reports help us with this, because we can make the PDF&acute;s files needed and just limit the users to get this information. Accordingly, the information is consolidated in a periodic manner and reviewed directly by supplies. The system involves the qualification of suppliers to identify areas of opportunity for each provider. Some reports are rejections, nonconformities, administrative costs, top ten rejections with nonconformities, corrective actions, the supplier charges and rejections index.
